 There was a little maiden
  In blue and silver drest,
 She sang to God in Heaven
  And God within her breast.

 It flooded me with pleasure,
  It pierced me like a sword,
 When this young maiden sang:  "My soul
  Doth magnify the Lord."

 The stars sing all together
  And hear the angels sing,
 But they said they had never heard
  So beautiful a thing.

 Saint Mary and Saint Joseph,
  And Saint Elizabeth,
 Pray for us poets now
  And at the hour of death.
